Spending time and resources assisting a related individual may at first seem destructive to an organism's chances of survival but is actually beneficial over the long-term. Since relatives share part of the helper's genetic make-up, enhancing each individual's chance of survival may actually increase the likelihood that the helper's genetic traits will be passed on to future generations.

Mantle convection is a process where heat from the Earth's core causes the mantle to heat up and rise, while cooler mantle material sinks. This creates a convection current that can move the tectonic plates on the Earth's surface. Additionally, the Earth's lithosphere, which includes the tectonic plates, has greater mechanical strength than the underlying asthenosphere. This allows the plates to move over the softer asthenosphere. Lateral density variations in the mantle also contribute to the movement of the plates.",

This is because males can potentially fertilize eggs at a much faster rate than females can produce them. Therefore, a male can best increase his reproductive success by finding and fertilizing as many different females as possible. In some species, males continue to court females even after mating.

        "model_answer": "Energy efficiency can be improved in several ways. In central heating systems, introducing zoned heating allows a more granular application of heat, similar to non-central heating systems. Zones are controlled by multiple thermostats that control zone valves in water heating systems and zone dampers in forced air systems, selectively blocking the flow of air. Efficiency can also be improved by choosing different components or redesigning the system. In terms of building design, insulating a home allows a building to use less heating and cooling energy to achieve and maintain a comfortable temperature. Installing LED lighting, fluorescent lighting, or natural skylight windows reduces the amount of energy required to attain the same level of illumination compared to using traditional incandescent light bulbs. Energy efficiency can also be improved by adopting more efficient technology or production processes.",
